There's a moment at around 7.30pm, when you don't have to do anything in particular. 

Sometimes a thought appears there: I could take a look at that thing.
Like redownload Framer to check if it's found product-market fit this year. Or start a little side project (a two-month rabbit hole). Some effort I don't have to make. It might be boring or demanding, or quietly satisfying twenty minutes later.

So the whole decision fits into a second. You either open it or you don’t.

Looking back at the year, the things I feel oddly proud of aren’t the big plans. They’re the ones that exist at all because, in that second, I said yes to "should I?".
